Integrity checks, such as digital signatures, shall be implemented on any serialized objects to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.
Strict type constraints during deserialization shall be enforced before object creation as the code typically expects a definable set of classes. Bypasses to this technique have been demonstrated; therefore, reliance solely on this technique is not advisable.
Code that deserializes shall be isolated and run in low privilege environments whenever possible.
Deserialization exceptions and failures; such as the cases in which the incoming type is not the expected type, or the deserialization throws exceptions; shall be logged.
Incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize shall be restricted or monitored. 
Deserialization shall be monitored, and an alert shall be issued if a user deserializes constantly.
